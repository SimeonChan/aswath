\section{Standard Formulae}

Presented below are a number of standard formulae. It is true that

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^k = a \frac{ 1-r^n} {1-r}
\label{eq_sf1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} a r^k = a r \frac{ 1-r^n} {1-r}
\label{eq_sf2}
\end{equation}


Given an interest rate, $i$, (e.g. use $i=0.05$ for 5\%), then

\begin{equation} r = 1 + i, \end{equation} 
(in our example, we would set $r=1.05$) would be the correct number to use in the forumla above.

Furthermore, the present value of a perpetuity, with each payment of $c$ being received at the end of each year is given by
\begin{equation}V =\frac{c}{ i}. \end{equation} 

If $\omega$ is the dividend cover, then $\theta$, the \index{retention ratio}\textbf{retention ratio}, is given by
\begin{equation}\theta =1 - \frac{1}{ \omega}. \end{equation} 

\section{Cost of capital}

The cost of capital for the \emph{company}, $h_1$, which is the hurdle rate, is given by

\begin{equation}
h_1 = \frac{M_e c_e + M_d c_d}{M_E + M_d}
\label{eq_cc1a}
\end{equation}

where $c_e$ is the cost of equity, $c_d$ is the after-tax cost of debt, $M_e$ is the market value of equity and $M_d$ is the market value of debt. So $h_1$ is the weighted average of the cost of equity and debt by market value.

Now,
\begin{equation}
c_e = r_f + \beta p,
\end{equation}

where $r_f$ is the risk-free rate, $\beta$ is the \emph{unlevered} beta of the firm, and $p$ is the equity risk premium.

So, for example, if we take $r_f = 3.72\% $, $\beta=1.29$, $p=5\% $, then
\begin{equation}
c_e = 3.72\% + 1.29 \times 4 \% = 9.16 \%
\end{equation}


Damodaran uses the 10-year treasury bond rate for the \index{risk-free rate}risk-free rate. For $\beta$, he uses \emph{unlevered} betas for the sector in which the company operates. If a company operates in several sectors, then a weighted average across sectors should be used.

The cost of debt is the risk free rate, $r_f$, plus a default spread $d$, adjusted for tax:
\begin{equation}
c_d = ( r_f + d) (1 - M_t)
\end{equation}
If available, $d$ can be obtained from bond rating agencies. More likely, a rating is not available, and must be synthasised instead. Rating agencies use a variety of financial rations, but Damodaran uses interest coverage, defined as the ratio of operating income to interest expeses, to be a simple and reliable heuristic. Using the interest coverage, it is possible to look up a default spread for a similar company.

The marginal tax rate, $M_t$, is used, as opposed to the tax rate as a whole, because debt saves the company tax at the margin. For 3M, Damodaran calculates
\begin{equation}
c_d = (3.72\% + 0.75 \% ) (1- 0.040) = 2.91\%
\end{equation}
The marginal tax rate is taken for 2008, where the federal corporation tax rate is 35\%, and local taxes add 5\% to this.

Using values of $M_e = \$57b$, $M_d=\$5.3b$, and substiuting the values for $c_d$ and $c_e$ obtain above into equation (\ref{eq_cc1a}) gives
\begin{equation}
h_1 = (9.16\% \times 57 + 2.91\% \times 5.3) / (57 + 5.3) = 8.63\%
\end{equation}
