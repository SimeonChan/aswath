\section{Standard Formulae}

Presented below are a number of standard formulae. It is true that

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^k = a \frac{ 1-r^n} {1-r}
\label{eq_sf1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} a r^k = a r \frac{ 1-r^n} {1-r}
\label{eq_sf2}
\end{equation}


Given an interest rate, $i$, (e.g. use $i=0.05$ for 5\%), then

\begin{equation} r = 1 + i, \end{equation} 
(in our example, we would set $r=1.05$) would be the correct number to use in the forumla above.

Furthermore, the present value of a perpetuity, with each payment of $c$ being received at the end of each year is given by
\begin{equation}V =\frac{c}{ i}. \end{equation} 

If $\omega$ is the dividend cover, then $\theta$, the retention ratio, is given by
\begin{equation}\theta =1 - \frac{1}{ \omega}. \end{equation} 

\section{Cost of capital}

The cost of capital for the \emph{company}, $h_1$, which is the hurdle rate, is given by

\begin{equation}
h_1 = \frac{M_e c_e + M_d c_d}{M_E + M_d}
\label{eq_cc1a}
\end{equation}

where $c_e$ is the cost of equity, $c_d$ is the after-tax cost of debt, $M_e$ is the market value of equity and $M_d$ is the market value of debt. So $h_1$ is the weighted average of the cost of equity and debt by market value.

Now,
\begin{equation}
c_e = r_f + \beta p,
\end{equation}

where $r_f$ is the risk-free rate, $\beta$ is the \emph{unlevered} beta of the firm, and $p$ is the equity risk premium.

So, for example, if we take $r_f = 3.72\% $,
