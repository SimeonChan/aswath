DCF valuation models in Python3

Python module which allows one to perform (eventually) the 
DCFs (Discounted Cash Flows) done by Aswath Damodaran. You 
will also be able to do ancillary calculations that you 
associate with all DCF worksheets.

The general rule seems to be:
- Maxima (a Mathematica clone) for symbolic mathematics
- Octave (a Matlab clone) for numerical computing
